# NYC Citi Bike Sharing Program - August 2019 data analysis by Gender

## Overview of the analysis: 

NYC Citi Bike data from August 2019 was used to analyze the use of bike rentals by gender.  Tableau Public was used to present this data in a story format by the total checkout times of bikes and broken down by the reported gender.  Another way to compare by gender is in the trips per weekday, separating by pay per ride customers vs long term subscribers to the Citi Bike service.

## Results: 

A Tableau story on this analysis provided the below results:

1. Total checkout times of all NYC Citi Bike users during August 2019.

## Summary: 

From the analysis in the Tableau story, we can see that Male Subscribers are the main users of Citi Bikes during August 2019.  This information may be helpful to help increase sales by targeting more Female to subscribe to Citi Bike service perhaps by advertising at select locations (ie., gym, shopping centers, etc.), using a Female spokesperson or sponsor or using more women as Citi bikers in the marketing strategies.  Additional visualization that may be helpful is a location map of any locations where there are less Female users to target for marketing.

The Tableau story also shared insight to the Hours of tripduration where there are high average use of 5-6 hours by Male users.  To add to this information, another visualization on mapping where these bikes that are used most frequently for over 5-6 hours would be helpful to track for service.  Another use of this data can be more focus on the ergonomics of the bikes based on Male vs Female physique, giving more bike options that are more suitable for Male vs Female long duration riders.
